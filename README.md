# Mini-Python-projects-for-logic-and-problem-solving
I am exploring field of data science, so currently, i am learning python and trying to build my logic with it.


# Naaz Mini Python Projects 🎯

This repository contains my **beginner-level Python projects** that I built to strengthen my **logic, problem-solving, and programming foundation**.  
Each program focuses on small, practical ideas that helped me understand Python syntax, loops, conditions, and functions.
